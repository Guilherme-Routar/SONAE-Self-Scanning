# SONAE Self-Scanning

Self-scanning is a mechanism introduced by Sonae, probably the biggest retail company in Portugal, which automates the process of shopping.

Self-scanning is a machine that allows customers to scan the products as they shop, avoiding the need to wait in queues. Besides saving customers' time, it reduces operational costs, staff required, etc.

Although such mechanism sounds good in theory, it doesn't work that well in practice. Customers may scan extra or fewer products than they should, making a divergent transaction.

In order to detect divergent transactions, I conducted a machine learning approach that improved Sonae's baseline results (F1) by 5 times.
